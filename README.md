# Bitcoin-Pesos Calculator


# About the developer:

Hello! Im Juan from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Bitcoin-Pesos was my first javascript based project. 
I live in a country where the dollar fluctuates daily. At the time, I thought of this APP to solve an inconvenience I had when continually entering my virtual wallet to know how many pesos my bitcoin holdings represent.


# The app:
What this app does is convert the amount you enter into Argentine pesos.
This works by calling 2 different web api's. One gets the dollar value of bitcoin in real time, and the other api gets the dollar value in Argentine pesos.

Another functionality that the app has is to simulate the value of bitcoins in pesos, also having the possibility of varying the value of bitcoin and the dollar. This is good to know how many pesos you would have if the bitcoin goes up to x, or if the dollar goes up to x number.

# App - Structure

The project consists of an input enabled to enter the value to be calculated and two inputs (one for the bitcoin value and the other for the dollar value) initially disabled.
When entering the value to be calculated, the system automatically performs the conversion without the need to submit.

Then we have 2 buttons on the right side:
The first button with the REFRESH drawing, just refreshes the input to be able to enter new values.
Then we have a button with an image of SETUP: this button enables the inputs that were disabled in order to simulate other values ​​for Bitcoin and Dollar.

# Upcoming features..

The next function and that is going to change the name of this app, is to convert Bitcoin Pesos into a crypto calculator, so that you can get the values not only of Bitcoin but of any other currency, and be able to convert it not only to pesos but to any other currency. eligible currency from an options menu.
